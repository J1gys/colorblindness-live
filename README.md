### Purpose of the Project
**VividView** is a real-time color blind accessibility enhancement tool through Daltonization. We aim to improve accessibility in visual content such that people with colorblindness may be able to view live camera feed in a manner that caters to their needs. Capabilities of the tool include presets for Deuteranomaly, Protanomaly, and Tritanomaly, as well as different ways to adjust the level of the correction & intensities of different color channels. There are also various video modifications such as zoom, flip, brightness, and contrast.
